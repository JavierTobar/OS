# Simulation of an OS

Note: I will be releasing an updated version 3.0 late March or early April.
       Version 3.0 will support virtual memory.

To run the program simply copy the files and execute: ./compile.sh
You may need to make compile.sh executable, execute chmod +x compile.sh

This Operating System simulates hardware such as RAM and CPU.

The Operating System uses Round-robin scheduling. 

Currently, it can execute any bash commands.

Documentation for the functions can be found in their respective header files. 
Some C files also contain comments explaining some design decisions. 

Feedback is appreciated.
